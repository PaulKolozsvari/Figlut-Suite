change across projects, customers are then often forced to develop their own custom solutions 
from scratch by purchasing developer hours instead of cheaper out-of-box solutions.</span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000"><br></span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000">Hence with so many businesses using up large amounts of time and resources developing data 
capturing applications, it has become evident that the various applications being developed only 
differ by their business logic i.e. the data being worked with and the business rules defining how 
the data should be validated as well as the relationships between the data e.g. purchase orders, 
proof of deliveries, stock movements etc.</span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000"><br></span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000">Technical features/logic on the other hand mostly remain the same across every data capturing 
system i.e. most will require a web service, mobile client, web site, reports, printing, data access 
layer, data transformation, log files, settings, connection management, varying data entry 
methods etc.</span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000"><br></span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000">Therefore due to this </span></font><font face="ArialMT"  color="#010101"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#010101">tight coupling of business logic with technical logic, it often results 
in the 
technical logic being reimplemented with each new project. This is not only results in an 
unnecessary loss of time and resources, but also tends to inflate the development costs of what 
are often just simple data capturing applications. We can then safely conclude that development 
costs can be minimized by separating the business logic from the technical logic.</span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  color="#010101"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#010101"><br></span></font></div><div align="justify"><font face="ArialMT"  color="#010101"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#010101">The Figlut Suite aims to achieve just that by providing reusable applications, utilities and 
developer kits which aim to abstract the technical logic. This results in </span></font><font face="ArialMT"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#000000">reduced development 
costs by </span></font><font face="ArialMT"  color="#010101"  size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-family:ArialMT; color:#010101">enabling customers and developers to focus more on the custom business requirements 
as opposed to reinventing the wheel with every new project. Most of the tools provided in the 
Figlut Suite are not specifically designed as complete solutions, but rather as add-ons to your 
existing infrastructure, thereby promoting flexibility instead of imposing constraints like many 
other frameworks tend to do.</span></font></div>
